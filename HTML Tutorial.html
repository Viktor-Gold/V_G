    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>

    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="dotted">HTML</span>)</b> is the standard markup language for creating
        web pages and web applications.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive <span class="dotted">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and
        render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="dotted">HTML</span> describes the structure of a
        web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    <p><span class="dotted">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="dotted">HTML</span> pages. With
        <span class="dotted">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
        into the rendered page. <span class="dotted">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by
        denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <span
            class="dotted">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span
            class="changeColor">&lt;img /&gt;</span>

        and <span class="changeColor">&lt;input /&gt; </span> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such
        as
        <span class="changeColor">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide information about document text and may include
        other tags as
        sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <span class="dotted">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the
        content of the page.
    </p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>

    <p><span class="dotted">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and
        their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. <span
            class="dotted">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like
        <span class="changeColor">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and
        <span class="changeColor">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for
        example
        <span class="changeColor">&lt;img&gt;</span>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is
        the end tag
        (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
    </p>

    <p>Another important component is the <span class="dotted">HTML</span> document type declaration, which triggers
        standards mode rendering.</p>

    <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>

    <pre><span class="uml">    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;</span>This a title <span class="uml">&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;</span>Hello world!<span class="uml">&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;</pre></span>
